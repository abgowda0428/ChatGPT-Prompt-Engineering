## ðŸ§  Key Learning Outcomes

1. **Prompting Principles**
   - Write **clear, specific instructions**.  
   - Ask the model to take structured steps (give it time to "think").  

2. **Iterative Development**
   - Start with a simple prompt.  
   - Refine systematically through trial and error.  

3. **Core LLM Applications**
   - **Summarizing** â†’ Condense reviews, articles, transcripts.  
   - **Inferring** â†’ Sentiment analysis, topic extraction, intent detection.  
   - **Transforming** â†’ Translation, format conversion, grammar fixes.  
   - **Expanding** â†’ Generate creative or extended content.  

4. **Chatbot Development**
   - Create context-aware multi-turn conversations.  
   - Use prompt chaining and structured memory.
